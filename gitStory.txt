	Mr. Monkey woke up at 7am this morning.  He made himself an everything bagel with jelly for breakfast, 
and then took a two hour long bubble bath.  Millard Monkey knew that this would be a special day, so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
brown suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his socks and sandals on.  He grabbed his umbrella, just in case, and left 
through the front door.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant yellow school bus smashing through his trash cans.
