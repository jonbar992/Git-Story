	Mr. Monkey woke up at 7am this morning.  He made himself a poppy seed bagel with jelly for breakfast, 
and then took a shower.  Millard Monkey knew that this would be a special day, so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
brown suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny red shoes on.  He grabbed his raincoat, just in case, and left 
through the window.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant yellow cat.
