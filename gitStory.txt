	Mr. Monkey woke up at 8am this morning.  He made himself a poppy seed bagel with jelly and bacon bits for breakfast, 
and then took a shower then washed his hair.  Milly Monkey knew that this would be a special day, so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
purple suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny silver shoes on.  He grabbed his cane, just in case, and left 
through the front door.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant school bus smashing through his trash cans.
